### What I learned
In this project I applied array methods  to render the stats data. 
I also used Counter.js  to make the count up effect on the stats look cool.



### Useful resources

- [CountUpJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/countup.js?activeTab=readme) - Used the documentation to create the effect
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onload.asp) - I used this site for reference to the onload event.
